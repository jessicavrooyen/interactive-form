# Interactive Form

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Add customized and contitional behaviour and interactivity. 
- validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. 

## Motivation
Instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript, you'll use the popular jQuery library to complete this project. While it's important for a developer to have a solid understanding and familiarity of plain vanilla JavaScript, it's also important to be able to understand and work with jQuery since it is so common and prevalent on the web.

The benefits of using jQuery are:

- Shorter and simplified syntax
- Help with cross-browser compatibility since jQuery deals with a lot of that stuff under the hood
- A strong familiarity with jQuery will only make you a better developer since it enjoys a strong market share on the web
